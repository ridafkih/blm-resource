# BLM Resource Aggregate

[You can view the mobile experience by clicking here](https://ridarf.github.io/blm-resource-aggregation/).

This was something I threw together on the morning of the Blackout Tuesday which was a movement to support African-Americans.

It is a console-style aggregation of resources for supporters to donate, find petitions, or view information about recorded abuse cases.
It was designed by Rida Fakih, and **is a modern mobile experience.**

Changes can, and should be suggested to Rida Fakih via [Instagram](https://instagram.com/rida.rf).
