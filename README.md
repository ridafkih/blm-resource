# BLM Resource Aggregate

A console-style aggregation of resources which could be used by members of the Black Lives Matter movement to find petitions, places to donate, and [TBA] resources for more information on the movement. 

It was designed by Rida Fakih, and is a mobile experience.

Changes can, and should be suggested to Rida Fakih via [Instagram](https://instagram.com/rida.rf).

Feel free to share resources without credit.
Report content you feel doesn't belong here to my Instagram.

It's important to note these resources were not individually vetted.
Resources were pulled using online scraping scripts, and were sampled, not tested.

This is simply an aggregation of resources found online.
Any content on any of the resources provided do not reflect
any personal political opinions.

Thank you.
